//  This singleton is used to manage uploading/downloading data from the remote REST API
//  It converts between local instances of Path, Point, Sailor, Vessel, etc objects and
//  remote objects which are transferred as JSON. 
//  
//  Local objects should have a globalID after the first time they are sent to the
//  server. Subsequent updates will use this globalID as a key to the remote object.
//  This should happen transparently; calls to this object only require the manage
//  object as a parameter.
